AGGP 294
Lab 04

Create a new Scene
	Add a Grid
	Add a new Script "CollisionExample"
		This new script will run the application 

Note: It is okay to change the color of the object to indicate the point is inside it. 

Part I
Create a Point that moves with the mouse position.
This will be refered to as "the Point" in the next part of the labs.  

Part II
Draw a circle on Screen. 
When the Point is inside the circle, draw the circle filled. 

Part III 
Draw a retangle on Screen. 
When the Point is inside the retangle draw the retangle filled.

Part IV 
Draw a triangle on Screen
When the Point is inside the triangle, draw the triangle filled. 

Requirement: 
The objects in 2,3,4 do not overlap each other. 

You will have to create a method to determine if a point is in side a Triangle. 
Reference: http://blackpawn.com/texts/pointinpoly/

You will have to derive a method to draw the filled triangle. 


Lab Notes: 
How to Draw a filled object... 
The a filled object will be two objects. The first is the solid object, the second is the outline. Use a boolean that is set during update to indicate when to draw the solid object. Draw the solid object first, then the outline. If you do the opposite, you can get into situations the solid outline hides the outline 

Drawing a Triangle
Drawing a triangle is easy, use 3 lines. 
To draw the fill of a trigangle will require you todraw each of the pixels inside the triangle. 
Given that this lab doesn't have the triangle moving, you can create a list of pixels to draw.
