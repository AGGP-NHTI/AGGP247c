* Add to DrawingTools:

public static float ToAngle(float radian) 
converts given radians into an angle value

public static float ToRadian(float angle)
converts given angle into a radian value

public static Vector2 CircleRadiusPoint(Vector2 Origin, float angle, float radius) 
this method finds a point on a circle given a radius and angle. 
This will place the point relative to the origin Vector 2. 
You will need to convert the given angle into a radian. 

public static void DrawCircle(SpriteBatch spriteBatch, float width, Color color, Vector2 Position, float Radius, int Sides)
Draws a Circle, 
Center of the circle is Position
If Sides < 3, make it something reasonable.
        
 


public static Vector2 EllipseRadiusPoint(Vector2 Origin, float angle, Vector2 Axis) 
Like CircleRadiusPoint, but scaling using the Axis Vector2 instead of the radius. 

public static void DrawEllipse(SpriteBatch spriteBatch, float width, Color color, Vector2 Position, Vector2 Axis, int Sides)
Draws an Ellipse, 
Center of the Ellipse is Position
If Sides < 3, make it something reasonable.



* Create an Ellipse Class
The purpose of this class is to collect all of the information for an Ellipse in an stucture. 
Use the following public members
   	public Vector2 Position = Vector2.Zero;	
	public Vector2 Center = Vector2.Zero;
        public Vector2 Axis = Vector2.One;
        public float Roation = 0;
        public int Sides = 32;
        public float Width = 2.0f;
        public Color color = Color.White;

Create Constructors & Draw Methods

* Create a Circle Class
	This will Inherit from your Ellipse class. 
Create Constructors, but Leverage the Draw method 


	

Extra Credit:

public static LineObject GenerateCircle(float width, Color color, float Radius, int Sides)
Generates a Line Object of a Circle
Local Center of the circle is 0,0
If Sides < 3, make it something reasonable.     
   
public static LineObject GenerateEllipse(float width, Color color, Vector2 Axis, int Sides)
Generates a Line Object of a Ellipse, 
Local Center of the circle is 0,0.
If Sides < 3, make it something reasonable. 
Axis Refers to the minor and major axis of the Ellipse for the X and Y Axis.
