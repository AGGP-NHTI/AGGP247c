* Add to DrawingTools:

public static float ToDegrees(float radian) 
converts given angle in radians into degree value

public static float ToRadians(float degree)
converts given angle in degrees into radian value

public static Vector3 CircleRadiusPoint(Vector3 Origin, float angle, float radius) 
this method finds a point on a circle given a radius and angle. 
This will place the point relative to the origin Vector 3. 
You will need to convert the given angle into a radian. 

public static void DrawCircle(Vector3 Position, float Radius, int Sides, Color color)
Draws a Circle, 
Center of the circle is Position
If Sides < 3, make it something reasonable.
        
Extra Credit: 
	Implement a version of DrawCircle using LineStrip


public static Vector3 EllipseRadiusPoint(Vector3 Origin, float angle, Vector3 Axis) 
Like CircleRadiusPoint, but scaling using the Axis Vector2 instead of the radius. 

public static void DrawEllipse(Vector3 Position, Vector2 Axis, int Sides, Color color)
Draws an Ellipse, 
Center of the Ellipse is Position
If Sides < 3, make it something reasonable.



* Create an Ellipse Class
The purpose of this class is to collect all of the information for an Ellipse in an stucture. 
Use the following public members
   	public Vector3 Position = Vector2.Zero;	
	public Vector3 Center = Vector2.Zero;
        public Vector3 Axis = Vector2.One;
        public float Roation = 0;
        public int Sides = 32;
        public float Width = 2.0f;
        public Color color = Color.White;

Create Constructors & Draw Methods
	* Overload your Draw Method to draw with a Grid2d

* Create a Circle Class
	This will Inherit from your Ellipse class. 

* Add two new draw groups (tab key controls drawing groups)
	* Circle Tests
		Test both the static draw function and the circle class
		Test On and off Grid Drawing
		Only one Circle can be at 0,0 on the grid. 
	* Elipse Tests	
		Test both the static draw function and the Elipse class
		Test On and off Grid Drawing
		Only one Elipse can be at 0,0 on the grid. 

Extra Credit:

public static DrawingObject GenerateCircle(float Radius, int Sides, Color color)
Generates a Line Object of a Circle
Local Center of the circle is 0,0
If Sides < 3, make it something reasonable.  
Test this in your Circle Test Group
   
public static DrawingObject GenerateEllipse(Vector2 Axis, int Sides, Color color)
Generates a Line Object of a Ellipse, 
Local Center of the circle is 0,0.
If Sides < 3, make it something reasonable. 
Axis Refers to the minor and major axis of the Ellipse for the X and Y Axis.
Test this in your Elipse Test Group
