Lab 1

Work with the following Resolution:
Standalone (1024x768)


Drawing Lines Diagram: 
	l||||l||||I||||l||||l

	Lines on the X Axis
	Division Count  = 5
	I = X Axis Line 	(X == 0) 
	l = Division Line 	(X%5 == 0) && (X != 0) 
	| = Nomral Line		(All other Lines) 


PART 1: 
	Create a "Grid2D" Class
	This class will be public

	MEMBERS: 
	Vector3 ScreenSize
		holds the size screen information	
		Initalize at Start 	
	
	vector3 Origin 
		Screen location of the grid origin 

	float GridSize, 		 default 10f
	float MinGridSize, 		 default 2f

		This how many pixels on the screen from one point to the next. 
		Your Grid will not be at the same size of your screen. 
		This float will control the size of the grid

	int DivisionCount, 			default 5
	int MinDivisionCount			default 2
		How many lines over should the
 		Division lines should be drawn
		Starting from the Axis. 

	float OriginSize 			Default .6f
		Controls size of origin point in relation to Grid Size

	
	Line Color members:
	Color AxisColor , 		Default White
	Color LineColor , 		Default Gray
	Color DivisionColor, 		Default Yellow

	Line Width Members:
	Float AxisWidth, 		Default 3
	Float DivisionWidth, 		Default 2
	Float LineWidth, 		Default 1

	Line Drawing Booleans:
	bool isDrawingOrigin,  		Default false	
	bool IsDrawingAxis, 		Default true
	bool isDrawingDivisions, 	Default true
	


	METHODS
	

	public Vector3 GridToScreen(Vector3) 
		Parm:   Vector3 in Grid Space
		return: Vector3 in Screen Space 

	public Vector3 ScreenToGrid(Vector3) 
		Parm:   Vector3 in Screen Space
		return: Vector3 in Grid Space 


	public void DrawLine(Line)	
		Line with positions in Grid Space
		Add this method this week with stub code. 
		We will revisit it in a future lab. 


	public void DrawOrigin()
		Draws the Origin Point (or Symbol) 


Part 2:	
The Axis will be represented by a Square Diamond. The points of the Diamond will be at +/- .2 in Grid Space on the axis  

Set the grid origin (0,0) to the center of the window. 

Part 3: User Interface


MouseWheel: 
	enlarge and shrink the gridsize variable 

Control + Mouse Wheel: 
	Enlarge or Shrink the Divison Count variable	

Middle Mouse button: 
	place the grid origin at the current mouse location 

Number Keys: 
	1: Toggle Draw Origin
	2: Toggle Draw Axis Line
	3: Toggle Draw Division Line

Extra Credit:
Add Keyboard Commands to control the Grid Origin, GridSize, DivisionCount
