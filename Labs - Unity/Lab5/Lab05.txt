Newtons's Laws of Motion

First Law: 
Velocity won't change unless another external force is applied

Second Law:
Velocity of an object changes when it is subjected to an external force
Acceleration is the change in Velocity
Ruled by the following equasion:
Force = Mass * Acceleration

Third Law: 
For every action (or force) there is an equal and opposite reaction

Equasions and Stats: 
Movement: 
	(F = ma)
		f = force
		m = mass
		a = acceleration
Gravity:
	f = G (M1M2 / r2)
 		f = force
		G = Gravitational Constant
		M1 = Mass of Object 1
		M2 = Mass of Object 2
		r2 = Squared of the Distance from Center of M1 to Center of M2
Mass of the Earth : 	 
	5.972 × 10^24 kg
Radius of the Earth: 	 
	6.371 million m 
Gravitational Constant : 
	6.67408 × 10-11 m3 kg-1 s-2
Gravity of Earth (at Sea level) : 
	~9.8 m/s
Gravity of Moon (at surface) : 
	~1.62 m/s²

Lab Requirements: 
You will be creating two scenes for this lab. 

Extra Credit
Either 
A) Create both in one scene with ability to switch back and forth between the two
B) Add an interface to switch between both scenes. 

Scene 1: 
SPACESHIP!!!!!!!!!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TYJyCCO8Dc

Create a simple spaceship. 

Use A\D to rotate the ship
W to Thrust Forward

W will add a force (an acceleration) to the ship based on the direction it is currently headed. You will need to store the current velocity of the ship and change the position of the ship based on this value. 

The Spaceship should not move faster than a stated value. Use a float to store this information. 

The Spaceship should warp from one side to the other if it goes off screen. 

Scene 2: 
Simple Cannon simulation

Draw a simple cannon or tank on screen. 
Draw a line for the ground. 

W\S to increase\decrease the Cannon's power 
A\D to rotate the cannon 
Space to Fire the Cannon

When you fire, create a "cannon ball" object (a circle is fine!).
It should move in a parabola with gravity slowing it's vertical movment at the top and pulling it down on the other side. 

When the cannon ball reaches the ground, stop it and pace it on the ground.
