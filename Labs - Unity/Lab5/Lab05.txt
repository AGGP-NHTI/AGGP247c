Newtons's Laws of Motion

First Law: 
Velocity won't change unless another external force is applied

Second Law:
Velocity of an object changes when it is subjected to an external force
Acceleration is the change in Velocity
Ruled by the following equasion:
Force = Mass * Acceleration

Third Law: 
For every action (or force) there is an equal and opposite reaction

Equasions and Stats: 
Movement: 
	(F = ma)
		f = force
		m = mass
		a = acceleration
Gravity:
	f = G (M1M2 / r2)
 		f = force
		G = Gravitational Constant
		M1 = Mass of Object 1
		M2 = Mass of Object 2
		r2 = Squared of the Distance from Center of M1 to Center of M2
Mass of the Earth : 	 
	5.972 × 10^24 kg
Radius of the Earth: 	 
	6.371 million m 
Gravitational Constant : 
	6.67408 × 10-11 m3 kg-1 s-2
Gravity of Earth (at Sea level) : 
	~9.8 m/s
Gravity of Moon (at surface) : 
	~1.62 m/s²


Option 1 - Asteroid clone. 
* Single Player
	- Extra Credit for More players
* Use Circle collison on all objects. 
* Playing field wraps 
* torpedo attacks 
	- Touch on other object will Destroy other players or torpedoes

Option 2 - Space War Clone
* Two players 
	- Extra Credit for More players
* torpedo attacks 
	- Touch on other object will Destroy other players or torpedoes
* Playing field wraps 
* Must have a gravity source from the center of playfield
* Option for placement of a planet or star in center of playfield
	- Touch will destroy player or torpedo 
* Round ends when one player is destroyed

Option 3 - Asteroid \ Space War Combo Clone
* See Above
* Two players 
	- Extra Credit for More players
* Asteroids in playing field should start with a velocity to orbit the gravity well

Option 4 - Lunar Lander Game
* Single Player
	- Extra Credit for More players
* Lander only has a single trust from the bottom
* Can Rotate at will
* Limited Fuel for trust 
* Random Terrain Generation 
* Landing succefully 
	- keep magnitude of movement below an amount
	- In right zone as well  

Option 5 - Tank-Scorched Earth \ Worms
* Two players 
	- Extra Credit for More players
* Tanks Don't Move
* Random Terrain Generation 
* Random placement of tanks on the field
* Each plater takes a turn to shoot
* Player sets force and angle to shoot. 
	- Thus Shot will arc due to gravity 
* Option to generate a random wind vector Per turn
