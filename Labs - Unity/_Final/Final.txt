Lab Final Project

Create a small game that features the math and physics used in the course:

Part 1: Talk with your instructor about the project you want to create. Submit a Concept document for your project and a GitHub Repository for the project. 


Below are Options for you consideration. You should consider adding more than what is listed to make this project your own.

Option 1 - Asteroid clone. 
* Single Player
	- Extra Credit for More players
* Use Circle collison on all objects. 
* Playing field wraps 
* torpedo attacks 
	- Touch on other object will Destroy other players or torpedoes 

Option 2 - Space War Clone
* Two players 
	- Extra Credit for More players
* torpedo attacks 
	- Touch on other object will Destroy other players or torpedoes

* Round ends when one player is destroyed

Option 3 - Asteroid \ Space War Combo Clone
* See Above
* Two players 
	- Extra Credit for More players
* Asteroids in playing field should start with a velocity to orbit the gravity well

Option 4 - Lunar Lander Game
* Single Player
	- Extra Credit for More players
* Lander only has a single trust from the bottom
* Can Rotate at will
* Limited Fuel for trust 
* Random Terrain Generation 
* Landing succefully 
	- keep magnitude of movement below an amount
	- In right zone as well  

Option 5 - Tank-Scorched Earth \ Worms
* Two players 
	- Extra Credit for More players
* Tanks Don't Move
* Random Terrain Generation 
* Random placement of tanks on the field
* Each plater takes a turn to shoot
