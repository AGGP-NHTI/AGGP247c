Part 3: 
	Create a 'DrawingTools' class

	Add and implement the following method: 
	public static void DrawRectangle(SpriteBatch spriteBatch, float width, Color color, Rectangle Rec)
		Hint: Use the LineDrawer.DrawLine Method
        
	Test this method in your project. 
Part 4: 
	Create a "Grid2D" Class
	This class will be public

	MEMBERS:
